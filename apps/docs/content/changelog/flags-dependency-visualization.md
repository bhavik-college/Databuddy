- Added visual dependency badges next to flag names showing dependency counts
- Blue badges indicate flags this flag depends on (with tooltip showing specific flags)
- Violet badges indicate flags that depend on this one (with tooltip showing dependents)
- Removed empty state placeholders ("—") for cleaner UI when fields are empty
- Tooltips show flag keys with active/inactive status indicators
