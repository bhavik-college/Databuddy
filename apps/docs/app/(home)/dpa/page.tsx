							What We Do with Your Data
						</h2>
						<p className="mb-4">
							We process visitor data from your websites to provide you with
							analytics insights. When someone visits your site, our script
							collects basic information and we turn that into the reports and
							metrics you see in your dashboard.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							This agreement stays active as long as you're using our service.
							When you decide to leave, we'll delete all your data unless you
							specifically ask us to return it to you first.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="mb-4 font-bold text-2xl">
							Why We Process Your Data
						</h2>
						<p className="mb-4">
							We process visitor data for one reason only. To give you useful
							analytics about your website. That means turning raw visitor
							interactions into charts, reports, and insights you can actually
							use.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							We don't use your data for our own business purposes, we don't
							sell it to advertisers, and we don't share it with anyone unless
							legally required to do so. <strong>Your data is yours.</strong>
						</p>
					</section>

					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="mb-4 font-bold text-2xl">What Data We Handle</h2>
						<p className="mb-4">
							We process IP addresses (which we immediately discard after
							getting location info), anonymous visitor signatures, general
							location data like city and country, and basic browser
							information. All data is anonymous by default - we never identify
							individual visitors.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							The people whose data we process are your website visitors. Since
							we don't collect personal information or identify users, all data
							processing involves anonymous visitor data only.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="mb-4 font-bold text-2xl">Our Commitments to You</h2>
						<p className="mb-4">
							We only process your visitor data according to your instructions
							and the service settings you choose. We won't use your data for
							anything else without getting your explicit permission first.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							Everyone on our team who has access to data is trained on privacy
							requirements and bound by strict confidentiality agreements. We
							take data protection seriously at every level.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							We maintain strong security measures to protect your data from
							unauthorized access, changes, or disclosure. This includes
							encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments.

					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="mb-4 font-bold text-2xl">Your Responsibilities</h2>
						<p className="mb-4">
							As the data controller, you need to make sure you have a legal
							basis for collecting visitor data through our service. This might
							mean getting consent from visitors when required, or relying on
							legitimate interest for basic analytics.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							You should provide clear privacy notices to your website visitors
							that explain how their data is processed. This includes mentioning
							that we process data on your behalf.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							When visitors contact you about their data, you're responsible for
							handling their requests. We'll help you fulfill these requests
							when they involve data we process for you.

						<h2 className="mb-4 font-bold text-2xl">
							How We Keep Your Data Secure
						</h2>
						<p className="mb-4">
							We use industry-standard security practices including encrypting
							data when it's transmitted and when it's stored, strict access
							controls, regular security reviews, and secure data centers in the
							EU.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							All personal data processing occurs exclusively within EU
							infrastructure provided by European companies for analytics event
							processing and storage. Some account, billing, and email delivery
							data is processed by our service providers and may involve
							international transfers depending on where those providers
							operate.

							you, unless we're legally required to keep some of it.
